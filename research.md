We formulate the problem as a partially observable decision process (POMDP) and solve it using imitation learning. We assume access to a simulator that provides all information needed for learning the tasks. Leveraging this privileged information, we train a POMDP expert that solves the task while performing informative actions using contacts. We then train an agent that acts on partial information by cloning this expert's behavior. We test our method on a novel robotics domain and set up an experiment with a real robot.
