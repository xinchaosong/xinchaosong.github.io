In this paper, we use the access to full states during training and imitation learning to train an intelligent agent that uses contacts to explore to solve a manipulation task. We formulate the problem as a partially observable decision process (POMDP) and solve it using imitation learning. We train a POMDP expert that solves the task while performing informative actions using contacts as well as an agent that acts on partial information by cloning this expertâ€™s behavior. We test our method on a novel robotics domain and set up an experiment with a real robot.
