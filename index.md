### Pix2Repair: Implicit Shape Restoration from Images

**<u>Xinchao Song</u>**\*, Nikolas Lamb\*, Sean Banerjee, Natasha Kholgade Banerjee. *arXiv preprint:2305.18273*. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18273)]

<img class="list-img-left" width="400" height="225" src="assets/images/pix2repair.png"/>

We present Pix2Repair, an automated shape repair approach that generates restoration shapes from images to repair fractured objects. Pix2Repair takes an image of the fractured object as input and automatically generates a 3D printable restoration shape. We contribute a novel shape function that deconstructs a latent code representing the fractured object into a complete shape and a break surface. We also introduce Fantastic Breaks Imaged, the first large-scale dataset of 11,653 real-world images of fractured objects for training and evaluating image-based shape repair approaches.

### Reinforcement-Learning Based Robotic Assembly of Fractured Objects Using Visual and Tactile Information

We present a reinforcement learning approach that combines visual and tactile information to automatically assemble repair parts to fractured objects. We propose two novel visual metrics, which we term pixel offset error and assembly error, to provide estimation of assembly state. Our approach does not place constraints on object geometry and estimates the assembly state of the constituent objects in real time. We show tightly assembled fractured and restored pairs in simulation and on real robots.

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly popular, with the number of connected devices reaching billions. This paper focuses on the fusion of IoT and robotics, called the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT), and discusses IoRT concepts, architectures, use case examples, key challenges, ethical issues, regulations, and future vision. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the emerging concept of IoRT, its benefits and limitations, as well as guidelines and directions for future research and studies.

### Belief-Grounded Networks for Accelerated Robot Learning under Partial Observability

We propose a method for policy learning under partial observability called the Belief-Grounded Network (BGN) in which an auxiliary belief-reconstruction loss incentivizes a neural network to concisely summarize its input history. Since the resulting policy is a function of the history rather than the belief, it can be executed easily at runtime. We compare BGN against several baselines on classic benchmark tasks as well as three novel robotic touch-sensing tasks. BGN outperforms all other tested methods and its learned policies work well when transferred onto a physical robot.
