# About Me

I am currently a Research Assistant advised by Prof. Robert Platt in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I have two master's degrees in computer science and mechanical engineering respectively with several years' relevant working and research experience. My research interest is robotics and machine learning with a focus on perception, planning, control, and manipulation, especially from an interdisciplinary perspective of software and hardware. My recent research is focusing on the applications of deep reinforcement learning to robotic tactile and force sensing.
